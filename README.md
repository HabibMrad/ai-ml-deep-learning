| Neural Networks Demystified | [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU) | :star::star::star::star: | Good intro to neural networks - heavy on math, uses Python code |
| CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition | http://cs231n.stanford.edu/ <br> https://cs231n.github.io/ <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC)  | :star::star::star::star::star: | Start Deep Learning education from this one - focused on image processing. Many lectures presented by Andrej Karpathy in 2016 videos |
| Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program from Udacity | [Course link](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) | :star::star::star::star::star: | $400 for 6 months course - you would need to spend at least 10h a week to complete it. Knowledge of Python 3.x and Numpy would make your life much easier - Pandas would help too. |
| CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing | http://cs224d.stanford.edu/ <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) | In Progress | Focus - NLP with Deep Learning |
| Deep Learning 101 | https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/introduction-deep-learning/ | Skip it | Tries to do overview without providing details - more like DP for non-IT person |
| Deep Learning with TensorFlow | https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/deep-learning-tensorflow/ | Skip it | Very high level with not enough "meat" |
